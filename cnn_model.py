           filter is [filter_height, filter_width, in_channels, out_channels] and is configured in config.conv_layers
           set padding='SAME' to keep the input size unchaged
           Strides, we match the convolution filter to all positions in the input thus set strides to [1, 1, 1, 1] accordingly.

        max_pool: tf.nn.max_pool
            ksize height and width are defined in config.pool_sizes (we use quadratic poolings)
            strides must be the same as ksize to tile the max pool filter non-overlapping
            So strides and ksize should be 1, pool_size_height, pool_size_width, 1
            set padding='SAME' to keep the input size unchaged
